Resolving Git Credential Manager Pop-Ups

When the Git Credential Manager keeps popping up, it can be frustrating. This issue often arises due to misconfigurations or conflicts in your Git settings.

Example

$ git push origin main
Pop-up appears asking for credentials repeatedly.

1. Check Credential Helper Configuration

The first step is to check your Git configuration for credential helpers. Multiple credential helpers can cause conflicts.

Example:

$ git config --list --show-origin | grep credential.helper
Solution: Remove conflicting helpers.

$ git config --global --unset credential.helper
$ git config --system --unset credential.helper
2. Use Credential Store

You can configure Git to store your credentials securely.

Example:

$ git config --global credential.helper store
This stores your credentials in a plain text file, which is less secure but prevents pop-ups.

3. Use Personal Access Tokens (PAT)

GitHub now requires using Personal Access Tokens (PAT) instead of passwords for authentication.

Example: Generate a PAT from GitHub and use it as your password when prompted.

4. Disable Modal Prompts

If you prefer not to see any pop-ups, you can disable modal prompts.

Example:

$ git config --global credential.modalPrompt false
5. Update Git and Credential Manager

Ensure you have the latest versions of Git and the Git Credential Manager
